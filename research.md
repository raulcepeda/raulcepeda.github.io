     We investigate the persistent impact of a colonial segregation policy on land values in modern Mexico City. During colonial times, Indigenous communities were confined, with varying degrees of success, to settlements known as pueblos de indios. Using historical records, we exploit quasi-random variation due to the pueblos' catchment areas and use a Regression Discontinuity Design to estimate the causal effects of pueblos on land prices. We find a 5% land value penalty for areas affected by the colonial policy. The penalty is exacerbated for the pueblos formerly inhabited exclusively by Indigenous populations. Historical evidence and novel digitized maps reveal that these land value penalties have been driven over the past two centuries by low public goods provision, negative economic expectations, and the historical sorting of working-class individuals who built small housing structures, or second-nature factors. Moreover, in contemporary data, we observe discontinuities in housing overcrowding and public goods quality within the pueblos' catchment areas. Our results underscore the repercussions of colonial policies on contemporary spatial equilibria, clarifying the mechanisms driving historical persistence and offering implications for urban policies.

  <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
    This paper investigates the immediate economic impacts of populist policies. In 2018, the Mexican president-elect held an unofficial referendum with less than 1% turnout to halt the construction of Mexico City’s New International Airport. I show that the policy is plausibly a natural experiment with nationwide impacts, preceding other macroeconomic shocks and populist policies dismantling economic and institutional checks. Using the synthetic control method, I find a 3.3% to 4.5% GDP reduction one year post-cancellation. Consistent with the uncertainty trap framework, this decline is due to heightened economic uncertainty and a significant drop in investment, reinforcing each other and leading to a prolonged economic downturn. The results highlight how populist policies can impose immediate economic costs by creating uncertainty traps, even before implementing institutional changes.

    Can traditional ethnoracial categories fully capture the economic disparities arising from physical traits, particularly within racially mixed populations in Latin America? This paper examines how skin tone shapes intergenerational economic disparities using data from over 80,000 individuals across 25 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. I present new descriptive evidence in three areas. First, I demonstrate that variations in skin tone within ethnoracial groups, such as Mestizos and Mulatos, account for income and education differences that are often overlooked by broader racial classifications. Second, I find a consistent negative correlation between darker skin tones and both income and human capital accumulation. Third, I reveal significant absolute gaps in intergenerational educational mobility by skin tone, highlighting persistent inequalities. These disparities in human capital and educational mobility remain robust when tested with a Mexican sample using machine-assessed skin tone measures from colorimeters. These findings contribute to the understanding of long-standing racial inequalities in the region and offer insights for broader discussions on race, mobility, and social identity.

  <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
    Charismatic leaders shape public sentiment but may weaken institutions by prioritizing personal appeal over trust in government. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mexican president publicly disregarded stay-at-home guidelines. We assess the impact on social distancing behavior using granular mobility and electoral data. Leveraging the timing of social distancing announcements and presidential support, we apply a dynamic IPW-DID design and find an 11.5% higher mobility in pro-president areas, leading to 38% more COVID-19 cases and 21% more deaths. Our findings suggest that the president’s public example, rather than partisan differences, primarily drove these effects.

    This paper investigates colorism, racial discrimination based on skin color, in men's football. Firstly, using machine learning algorithms, we extract players' skin tones from online headshots to examine their impact on fan-based ratings and valuations. We find evidence of a skin tone penalty, where darker-skinned players face lower fan-driven market values and ratings. Secondly, using algorithm-based ratings and employing a Difference-in-Discontinuities design with geolocated penalty kicks data, we show that lighter-skinned players enjoy a premium higher by one standard deviation than their darker-skinned peers, conditional on scoring a penalty. 
Additionally, we find evidence that non-native players with dark skin face a double penalty. 
Leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, we highlight the role of fans' stadium attendance in algorithm-based results. 
The findings underscore direct skin tone discrimination in football and highlight fans' role in perpetuating algorithmic bias.

    This paper investigates the impact of the Mexican cadastre modernization program on local property tax revenue. We evaluate a comprehensive modernization initiative, which began in 2010 and included guidelines, technical assistance, and subsidies for local cadastres. Using panel data from 2000 to 2019 and a Difference-in-Differences approach, we find that municipalities adopting the program saw a 10% increase in property tax revenue within five years, rising to 30% after eight years. This effect varies significantly with local state capacity and the coordinating institution implementing the program. The program significantly enhances the state of local cadastres over the long-term. Municipalities that adopt the program are more likely to invest in staff training, implement comprehensive cadastral management systems, and digitize their registries. Our results highlight the importance of local capacities and coordination in realizing the benefits of decentralization and modernization policies.
