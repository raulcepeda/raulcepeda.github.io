I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research is supervised by [Suanna Oh](https://www.suannaoh.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thierry Verdier](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/verdier-thierry/){:target="_blank"}, with [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/){:target="_blank"} serving on my thesis committee.

I previously completed my BA and MSc at [CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/division_de/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico.

My doctoral research focuses on how historical processes, institutions, and cultural identities contribute to persistent inequalities. Specifically, I examine two key areas: 

1. The long-term effects of colonial segregation on urban spatial equilibrium and the development of human capital through neighborhood identities.  
2. The influence of racial inequalities, particularly colorism, through intergenerational gaps and discrimination.

In addition to my doctoral work, I am also interested in the political economy of populism: exploring how populist policies impact economic activity and how the behavior of populist leaders shapes the social dynamics of their partisanship.
