I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and the [École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research is supervised by [Suanna Oh](https://www.suannaoh.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thierry Verdier](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/verdier-thierry/){:target="_blank"}, with [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/){:target="_blank"} serving on my thesis committee.

I previously completed my BA and MSc at the [Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico, and earned a master's degree in Analysis and Policy in Economics from [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ape-analysis-policy-in-economics/){:target="_blank"} in France.

My research interests center on the political economy of development, historical economics, and cultural/social economics.

I am currently researching the long-term effects of colonial segregation on spatial equilibrium within cities and the accumulation of human capital through local or neighborhood identities. Another area of my work focuses on racial inequalities and discrimination, particularly colorism. Additionally, I examine the economic impacts of populist policies on economic activity and the influence of populist leaders on public health outcomes.
