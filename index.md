I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and the [École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research is supervised by [Suanna Oh](https://www.suannaoh.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thierry Verdier](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/verdier-thierry/){:target="_blank"}, with [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/){:target="_blank"} serving on my thesis committee.

I previously completed my BA and MSc at the [Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico and earned a (M2) master's degree from [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ape-analysis-policy-in-economics/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests center on the political economy of development, historical economics, and cultural/social economics.

The central focus of my doctoral research is on *durable or persistent inequalities*, exploring how historical processes, institutions, and cultural identities dynamically shape economic and social disparities. I am currently researching the long-term effects of colonial segregation on spatial equilibrium within cities and the accumulation of human capital through neighborhood identities. I also study racial inequalities, particularly colorism, and its effects on human capital accumulation and direct skin tone discrimination.

Apart from my main doctoral research, I am interested in the political economy of populism: how populist policies affect economic activity and the social influence of populist leaders’ actions on their partisanship decisions.
