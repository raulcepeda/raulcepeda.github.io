I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and the [École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. My doctoral research is supervised by [Suanna Oh](https://www.suannaoh.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thierry Verdier](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/verdier-thierry/){:target="_blank"}, with [Ekaterina Zhuravskaya](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/zhuravskaya-ekaterina/){:target="_blank"} serving on my thesis committee.

I previously completed my BA and MSc at the [Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico.

My research interests focus on the political economy of development, historical economics, and cultural/social economics.

My doctoral research examines how historical processes, institutions, and cultural identities shape durable inequalities, with a focus on two main areas. First, I investigate the long-term effects of colonial segregation on urban spatial equilibrium and the accumulation of human capital through neighborhood identities. Second, I explore the role of racial inequalities—particularly colorism—in shaping educational and economic outcomes, focusing on educational intergenerational mobility and direct discrimination.

Beyond my doctoral research, I am also interested in the political economy of populism, specifically how populist policies influence economic activity and how the actions of populist leaders shape partisanship and social dynamics.
