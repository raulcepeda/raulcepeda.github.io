I am an economist at [Banco de México](https://www.banxico.org.mx){:target="_blank"}, where I work in the **Dirección General de Investigación Económica**, specifically in the **Macrofinancial Analysis Area**. I earned my B.A. in Economics from [CIDE](https://www.cide.edu/){:target="_blank"} in Mexico City.

My current academic interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomic policy, inequality, and innovation. I am particularly focused on **applied time series**, **policy evaluation**, and **financial markets and credit dynamics**.

I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics, or alternatively a Master's program that will strengthen my academic profile for future doctoral studies.

This page serves as a repository for my research interests, academic background, and future projects.
